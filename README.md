# BookShelf
Online book store

BookShelf is an online platform where users can browse, search, and purchase books from a wide range of categories.

# Client
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Backend Endpoints

The backend of the BookShelf project provides the following endpoints:

### User Authentication
- `POST /user/signup`: Create a new user account
- `POST /user/login`: Login with existing credentials

### Books Management
- `GET /books`: Get all books

These endpoints are accessible at `http://localhost:4001` base URL as configured in the client application.
